          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Learning how to keep calm and solve problems</h3>
          <p>Learning something new can be hard, there are plenty of ups and downs with feelings of failure and triumphs but remember that most great things don’t come easy!
          </p>

          <p>For me, learning to code has been getting used to sometimes getting stuck on a simple problem. Recently, I was trying to write a piece of code that would loop through a list of items and return specific data. I started to get frustrated when the code wasn’t working and it wasn't returning the data I was expecting.
          </p>
          <p>I ended up having to take a break and go make a cup of tea to distract me for a few minutes. Once I returned to my screen, I took another look and began to read over the code and break down what the issue was. 
          </p>
          <p>I reviewed the code that I had written and saw that instead of writing an i, I had a 1! 
          </p>

            <p>This was the reason my code was not working, because this code would be infinitely looping and I had no idea why. 
          </p>
          <p>Personally, I find breaking down a problem into smaller parts helpful, I can start small and then it all starts to make sense. Sometimes when I am looking at the problem as a whole I will find myself lost in it but if I break it all down into pieces I am able to see clearer. 
          </p>
          <h3>Finally, I elegantly solved a problem!</h3>
          <p>Working through some set Javascript challenges, I found my next  task was specifically about manipulating objects, I had been having a little issue with getting my head around objects in Javascript. When tackling this problem I first thought about how I should approach it. I broke down the problem in plain english to myself and began to work on it bit by bit. The problem had 11 steps to work through and to my surprise I managed to get through each with passes. 
          </p>
          <h3>Problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
          <p>There are many problem-solving techniques/processes to use while coding.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode </strong> - plain language description. This is something I can see I will use more of as it helps me visualise what needs to be done.</li>
            <li><strong>Try something </strong> - giving something a go, I often do this. After I have watched a video or read an article on how to do something, I will try it out. </li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - when a programmer gets held back by bugs, the code is explained line by line to a rubber duck.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages </strong> - I find the error messages super useful when learning, often the errors are listed in the message!</li>
            <li><strong>Console.logging </strong> - Using this as I write code to check if it is working and doing what I want it to do is very useful to me. </li>
            <li><strong>Googling </strong> - this is by far what I do the most. For most problems there is someone out there who has already gone through it before you and posted about it. </li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers/coaches for help </strong> - going through a coding bootcamp has many benefits but the fact that you have access to others who are going through the same thing as you is beneficial in so many ways. </li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection </strong> - reflection each day is helping me look at how I am responding to tasks and how I am treating myself internally. It’s a constant journey to reflect but for me, it is an important tool. </li>
