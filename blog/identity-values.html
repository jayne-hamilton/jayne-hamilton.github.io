          <h2>Exploring My Core Values & Identity</h2>
          <h4>While thinking about my own values, I asked myself 3 questions
            <ol>
              <li>"What are my core values?"</li>
              <li>"Where have I learnt these values?" </li>
              <li>"Why are these values so important to me?"</li>
          </h4>
          </ol>
          <p>To answer these questions, I thought about my childhood. I have very fond memories growing up. As a kid, I always 
            felt that I was safe and loved but like many kiwi families of the time, we didn’t openly discuss our core values as a family much. 
          </p>   
          <p>Looking back, I had to move away from home and travel the world to really learn my own identity and values. 
            I’m grateful to the twenty-one-year-old me for heading overseas on a whim and experiencing an array of different cultures. 
            I didn’t understand how important it was at the time but backpacking had a positive impact on me. 
            Travelling alone encouraged me to meet new people and experience new situations and over time I discovered what traits I value as important. 
            My personal identity and beleifs have been formed over time from my experiences but honesty, empathy and creativity have been consistent 
            on my journey. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The phrase "you are who you surround yourself with" really resonates with me, I’ve realised that surrounding myself with like-minded 
            people is important to me. Spending time with people who want to see me achieve my goals and celebrate my wins is important 
            to me. I feel like I can be a better version of myself when I am surrounded by people who I want to be like. 
        </p>
          <h4>Thoughts on Strengths and Limitations</h4>  
          <p>When considering what I felt my strengths and limitations were, I wondered if the people closest to me would agree with how I viewed myself.
            I took the <a href="https://high5test.com/">High5test</a> to see what it suggested my top 5 strengths were. The results were surprisingly 
            what family and friends (and past colleagues!) have described me as with focussed being number one.
          </p>
          <p>Being focused and organised can mean efficiency in the workplace but it can also be a downfall if you end up spending too 
            much time trying to plan every single thing to go a certain way. I feel as though setting intentions and goals each day/week 
            is helpful as long as I am taking the time to reflect and to be present when I need to be. 
            </p>
          <p>Summary of strengths:</p>
            <ol>
              <h4><li>Focus Expert</h4>your objective is to focus on what’s most important</li>
            <h4> <li>Deliverer</h4>your underlying goal is to take responsibility</li>
              <h4> <li>Philomath </h4>your objective is to learn new things</li>
              <h4> <li>Timekeeper</h4>your objective is to set timelines and deadlines</li>
              <h4> <li>Empathizer</h4>your objective is to be empathetic to others’ emotions</li>
            </ol>
          <p> I've found that sometimes limitations mean reaching out for help from others or perhaps taking time to upskill in order to complete 
            a task. 
            There have also been times when limitations can occur from others while working in a team. I find that when 
            resistance or tension occurs, I try to understand that each person is coming from a different set of values and 
            experiences and I try to see it from their point of view. Usually, if I approach a tense situation with that mindset then I'll 
            remain calm and we can reach an agreement.
