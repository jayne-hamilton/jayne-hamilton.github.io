              <h2>What's the difference between Classes & ID's?</h2>
              <p>Both ID's and classes are selectors used in HTML and CSS. The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID is only used to identify one single element in HTML, a class can be used to identify more than one HTML element.</p>
              <h3>ID's</h3>
              <p>An ID value can be given to only one HTML element.</p> 
                  <div class="id-example">
                  <img
                  class="id-image"
                  src="../images/id-example.jpg"
                  alt="screenshot of id example"
                  />
                  </div>
              <p>Example: the ID selector for header and name are listed on CSS with a hash(#) symbol before the HTML element name. This is becuase these elements are used once across pages.</p> 
              <h3>Classes</h3>
              <p>A class value can be given to one or more HTML elements, usually of the same type.</p>
                  <div class="id-example">
                  <img
                  class="id-image"
                  src="../images/button.jpg"
                  alt="screenshot of class example"
                  />
                </div>
              <p>Example: the button element is selected as a class, this means that all buttons with .button will have the same styling.</p>
              <h3>When to Use Class vs ID in CSS</h3>
              <p> A rule to keep in mind when using ID and classes is that ID is used for single elements that appear on the page only once (e.g. header, footer), and class is used for single or multiple elements that appear on the page once or more (e.g. paragraphs, links, buttons). It is best practice to use the correct selector and if you don’t need to use them then don’t use them. Any styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class. The hash symbol that is used for ID’s can be read by a browser. The hash shows in the URL and the browser will open and scroll to the element. JavaScript depends on there being only one-page element with any particular id, or else the commonly used getElementById function wouldn’t be dependable.</p>
