               <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
               </h4>
               <div class="reflections-list">
               <ol>
                  <li>Learning about growth mindset and neuroplasticity was really interesting to me as this helped me understand that I could achieve my goals and learn new skills. The imposter syndrome feeling is still there but it is not as loud with the knowledge that I can rewire my brain.
                  </li>
                  <li>I have had many ups and downs during foundations as I got covid and I still have some lingering symptoms which impact on my learning.  I have found that spending time each morning to set intentions and plan out my day with time and goals has been useful.
                  </li>
                  <li>I have learnt not to compare myself to others as much as I did when I began. Understanding that everyone comes from a different background and experience. 
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
               <h4>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
               <p>Values - understanding where you are and where you are going and what for. </p>
               <p>Empathy - being able to see things from another person's point of view. </p>
               <p>Self-awareness - understanding your own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
               <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
               <p>I was surprised by my learning of emotional intelligence, not because I didn't know what it was but because I didn't really understand it and how important it is. I enjoyed learning about it and how I can increase my EQ through mindfulness and repetitiveness.</p>
               <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>   
               <p>Emotional Intelligence, I feel this is something that I can really work on. While learning something new it is easy to fall into the thoughts of “I can’t do this” but this is where I want to work on shifting and challenging these thoughts.</p>
