        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <h4>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>I am aiming to gain the skills and confidence to secure my first Web Developer position at a company that aligns with my values. My preference is to work within an organisation with seasoned developers in order to conitinue my learning. </p>
        <h4>Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
        <p>I'm focused when I'm learning about a topic that I enjoy. I see myself as a highly organised individual. I find that with learning something new, I often pick it up faster when I can relate to the topic. I find video content helpful when learning. A limitation would be if that topic is something that I don’t get straight away so I will have to take time to either read/watch over the information again to let it sink in. </p> 
        <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>I would like to work on my interview skills, specifically how to represent myself in a clear way when answering questions. </p>
        <h4>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h4>
        <p>I intend to fully commit to any tasks or requirements I need to do whether that is in a team or with education staff etc. I treat others as I hope to be treated.</p>
        <h4>How you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h4>
        <p>I’m comfortable sharing thoughts and feelings when necessary with the group or a facilitator. I also have a tight network around me personally I can reach out to.</p>
        <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>I will always try to solve something myself but if I need to reach out then I will use the discord channels appropriately.</p>
        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>I’m hoping that I will be able to reach out to the Facilitation team if required but part of the reason I applied to Dev Academy is that the education team is there to “facilitate” students on their journey. I am ready to soak up all of their knowledge and advice.</p>
        <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>I have kept my schedule free for my study but I plan to make the most of my surroundings and head outdoors for a lunch/exercise break (12-2 pm give or take) when the weather permits.</p>
