              <h2>JS Fundamentals</h2>
              <h3>What is Javascript and how is it related to HTML & CSS?</h3>
              <br>
              <div class="id-example">
                <img
                class="id-image"
                src="../images/html-css-js.jpg"
                alt="html css js symbol"
                />
                </div>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. When a website is interactive with pop-ups or has a form to complete then Javascript is most likely involved. HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to form the front-end design of a website by applying information that affects the content, style and interactivity of a site.  </p>
                <p>Let's think of the analogy of a robot vacuum...</p>
                <p>A robot vaccum has features listed like buttons - <em>HTML, the webpage content</em></p>
                <p>A robot vacuum is designed with a look and feel such as size and colour of the vaccum - <em>CSS, the webpage style</em></p>
                <p>A robot vacuum has the functionality to suck or to move around - <em>JavaScript, the webpage doing something</em></p>
                <div class="id-example">
                  <img
                  class="id-image"
                  src="../images/irobot.jpeg"
                  alt="html css js symbol"
                  />
                  </div>
                <h4>Control flow</h4>
                <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, in order of execution. Again, we can think of our robot vacuum. The robot vacuum has a list of code that it will work through from first line to the last line, this code will has specific instructions for the robot to complete.</p>
              <h4>Loops</h4>
              <p>We often need to repeat things when writing code. Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times. There are different kinds of Loops depending on the scenario but essentially a loop is a repetition through a piece of code.</p>
              <h4>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
              <p>Both objects and arrays are common in JavaScript. Objects represent a special data type that can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that can also be used to store a list of values. </p>
              <h4>Arrays</h4>
              <p>When the order of the elements is important, use Arrays, when order is not important, use objects.</p>
              <h4>Objects</h4>
              <p>Objects are the most powerful data type of javascript as they are used in almost everything. Functions are objects, Arrays are objects, Regular Expressions are objects and of course, objects are objects.</p>
              <h4>What are functions and why are they helpful?</h4>
              <p>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.</p>
              <h4>The DOM</h4>
              <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
                A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated.</p>
              <p>As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
