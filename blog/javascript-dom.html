              <h3>What is Javascript and how is it related to HTML & CSS?</h3>
              <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. When a website is interactive with pop-ups or has a form to complete then Javascript is most likely involved. HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to form the front-end design of a website by applying information that affects the content, style and interactivity of a site.  </p>
              <p>Let's think of the analogy of a robot vacuum...</p>
              <p>A robot vaccum has features listed like buttons - <em>HTML, the webpage content</em></p>
              <p>A robot vacuum is designed with a look and feel such as size and colour of the vaccum - <em>CSS, the webpage style</em></p>
              <p>A robot vacuum has the functionality to suck or to move around - <em>JavaScript, the webpage doing something</em></p>

                class="center-image"
                src="../images/irobot.jpeg"
                alt="html css js symbol"
                 />
              <h4>Control flow</h4>
              <p>Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. The computer reads this script in order from the first line of code in the file to the last line, unless it is told otherwise.</p>
              <h4>Loops</h4>
              <p>Instead of completing a block of code over and over manually, Loops can be used. Loops are a way to run through the same code block a specific number of times. Loops have conditions placed to run until it has reached a certain time to stop, a loop will continue to run until the defined condition returns true or false. If there is no condition to stop then a loop can be infinite, although this is not best practice as it's not very good for our browsers.  </p>
              <h4>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
              <p>Both objects and arrays are common ways to store data in JavaScript. Objects represent a data type that can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a type of variable that can also be used to store a list of values. </p>
              <h4>Arrays</h4>
              <p>Square brackets [] are used to show that the content within the brackets is an array. An array is data within the square brackets each separated by a comma. The data within the array is represented by an index number where is sits within the square brackets. This index always begins at 0, so the first item in an array will be index 0.</p>
              <h4>Objects</h4>
              <p>Objects are used to store data, the data can be stored in different properties listed within the object. Properties can include different data types such as strings, numbers or booleans etc. Objects are a useful way to store different types of data that relate to one object. </p>
              <p>An example of an object, could be a person. An object that is created for a person may include the properties of name, age, hair colour etc. </p>

              alt="screenshot of object"
              >
              <h4>Functions</h4>
              <p>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.</p>
              <h4>The DOM</h4>
              <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
                A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated.</p>
              <p>As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
