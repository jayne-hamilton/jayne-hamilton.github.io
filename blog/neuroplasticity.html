         <h2>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h2>
         <hr>
         <h3>Neuroplasticity, what is it?</h3>
         <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its connections or re-wire itself. There are plenty of benefits such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
          <li>The ability to enhance existing cognitive capabilities</li>
          <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
          <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined</li>
          <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is responsible for learning, developing, and forming memories. The brain is consistently rewiring itself and modifying its connections. 
        </p>
        <p>Knowledge is key, and in this case the knowledge of neuroplasticity means unlocking so much potential to learn and grow.There are ways to increase neuroplasticity such as learning a new language, reading and diet.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>When you look up “Growth Mindset”, the internet tells us that Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time.
         </p>
         <p>A growth mindset is looking at problems as interesting challenges that need to be fixed. I found that the more that I explored the growth mindset the more I believed in how vital it is for me on my learning journey. Having gone for so many years with the thoughts of learning a complete new skillset was too hard and that I couldn’t possibly understand meant that I started to really believe it.  
         </p>
         <p>I have integrated a growth mindset into my own learning journey by taking the time to study each day. Before I start studying I take time each morning to be present and mindful of where I am and set intentions for the day. Part of this routine is to acknowledge that through this learning journey I am facing new concepts for the first time which can seem daunting, I like to acknowledge this at the start of the day so I am aware and present that with a growth mindset I can do this.
