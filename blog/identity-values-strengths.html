        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>Growing up, my family didn’t vocalise much about values or even feelings for that matter. My parents are generous and kind people who were (and still are) always helpings others but I don’t recall ever exploring our values as a family. Looking back, I had to move away from home and travel the world to really learn my own identity and values. I’m grateful to the twenty-one-year-old me for heading overseas on a whim and experiencing many different countries and cultures. I didn’t understand how important it was at the time but backpacking had a positive impact on me. Travelling alone and staying in shared dorm rooms forced me to meet new people and experience new situations, it really opened my eyes to what I value as important. 
        </p>
        <p>I've been thinking a lot about my personal values lately and how these have been formed over many different experiences. Values that have been consistent along my journey are honesty, empathy and creativity. Recently, I have made reflection an important practice of mine. Taking the time to reflect on my day, week or any period of time to be present with my thoughts and learnings that may arise.
        I’ve heard that you are who you surround yourself with and over the past few years, I’ve realised that surrounding myself with like-minded people who lift me up is important to me. Spending time with people who want to see me achieve my goals and celebrate my wins is important to me. Taking the time to review what values align with me has meant I have made friends who are honest, positive, take accountability, are curious and have a great sense of humour. I feel like I can be a better version of myself when I am surrounded by people who I want to be like.

        <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>  
        <p>When considering what I felt my strengths and limitations were I did wonder if the people closest to me would agree with how I view myself. I took the high5test out of interest to see what it said my top 5 strengths are. Usually, I find these tests to be slightly off the mark but the results were surprisingly what family and friends (and past colleagues!) have described me as. 
        </p>
        <b>Here is a quick summary of these strengths:</b>
      <ol>
        <li><h5>Focus Expert</h5>your objective is to focus on what’s most important. To do this, you need something concrete to focus on, so weekly, monthly and annual goals are your biggest allies.</li>
        <li><h5>Deliverer</h5>your underlying goal is to take responsibility. If anyone is emotionally bound to follow through on their promises, it’s you, the Deliverer. </li>
        <li><h5>Philomath </h5>your objective is to learn new things. You have a genuine thirst for knowledge and others appreciate your curiosity. 	</li>
        <li><h5>Timekeeper</h5>your objective is to set timelines and deadlines. Surprises annoy you, so you prefer to plan everything. You don’t necessarily need full control, but there must be order and predictability in the world around you. </li>
        <li><h5>Empathizer</h5>your objective is to be empathetic to others’ emotions. You have a natural ability to step into another person’s shoes, even if you don’t agree with their feelings or perspective. </li>
      </ol>
       <p>Reviewing this list I see both strengths and limitations in terms of my learning and career development. I see that being focused and organised can mean efficiency and productive outcomes for tasks but I also see that trying to plan everything out can be a downfall when working in code as there can be a lot of random problems that need attention. I feel as though setting my intentions and goals each day/week is helpful as long as I am taking the time to reflect and to be present when I need to. 
      </p> 
        <p>I've previous experience working on projects which generally involve a lot of different personalities and views. I have found that when resistance or tension occurs in the workplace I try to take the view that each person is coming from a different set of values and experiences and I try to see it from their point of view. Usually, if I approach a tense situation with that mindset then I am going to remain calm and listen to their side and come to an agreement.
